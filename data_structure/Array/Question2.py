#  Question 2 
#  leet code que 1: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#  You can return the answer in any order.

# Use Case:1

# expected = [1,2]

# Use Case:3
# nums = [3,3]
# target = 6
